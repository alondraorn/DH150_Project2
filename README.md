# Pilot Usability Test 



## Introduction 

UT stands for "Userability Testing" and is a way to see how easy it is to use something by testing it with people. By asking a participant to take a userability test with the "SpaceJam" website, I am able to see how feasabile, accessibile and efficient the website is the the public. By asking them to look up certain activities or phrases, I can see how easy or difficult it is for them to navigate throughout the website. The "Userability Test" helps tell me which 10 usability heuristics 
the website is lacking or already has. For instance, by reading the participant's facial expression or hearing their thoughts, I can take away that the website does not keep us informed about what is going on and this makes it difficult to evaluate feedback. Depending on the user's comments I can also tell that the "consistency and standards" is also missing from the website. Overall, depending on the comments and reactions of the user during the userability test, I can gague what aspects of the website I need to fix and what apsects of the 10 usability heriistics are lacking.
